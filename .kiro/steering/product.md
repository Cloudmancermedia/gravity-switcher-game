# Product Overview

## Gravity Switcher Game

A browser-based arcade game inspired by VVVVVV and Flappy Bird mechanics. Players control a character (Kiro sprite) that can flip gravity direction to navigate through moving obstacles with gaps. The core mechanic is gravity reversal - pressing SPACE or clicking flips gravity completely, sending the player in the opposite direction.

## Key Features
- Gravity flip mechanic (press SPACE/click to reverse gravity)
- Side-scrolling obstacles with gaps (Flappy Bird style)
- Score tracking (points for each obstacle passed)
- Three game states: start screen, active gameplay, game over
- Kiro brand theming with purple accent colors
- Responsive controls (keyboard and mouse)

## Target Audience
Built as a demo for AWS re:Invent 2025 workshop, designed for developers learning game development with Kiro AI assistant.
